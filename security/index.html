    <h1> Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment </h1>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> I was hired to find security vulnerabilities on Ming Chow's NotUber app. This application allows riders and a select group of vehicles to set their location and see other active vehicles and riders respectively.</p>
    <h2>Methodology </h2>
    <p> To test this site, I first employed "black box" testing by looking at the app without viewing the source code. After identifying several potential problems I examined the code for other issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used curl and Chrome during my testing of this app.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3> No user validation </h3>
                <p> Users do not need to validate their identies in order to send location updates. A malicious user could send a request with someone else's ID, resulting in fraud. The service could also easily be broken by going through all current IDs and setting all rider/vehicle locations to some arbitrary location like the middle of the pacific ocean.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> User tracking </h3>
                <p> All riders latest check in locations are publically avaliable on the front page. This opens clients up to being tracked by third parties through this data. A passenger could also record IDs of vehicles and track them by requests to the /vehicle.json page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> Code injection via username </h3>
                <p> Since there are no limits on user names or validation, a malicious "rider" could use a piece of code as their username. When the company home page is displayed, their username will be put onto the page and the injected code will be run whenever anyone else opens the page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> Accessing vehicle information without ID </h3>
                <p> Because of the way the /vehicle.json&username=(username) route reads in the given username, a malicious user could write code allowing them to get the ID and data from a user whose ID they do not currently have.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

                        There is no way to ensure that a "rider" is real and not spam, or that anyone is in the location the app puts them at. Anyone can edit anyone's location. This issue makes the app basically non-functional.

You could strip the data of identifying information to prevent tracking but that still potentially leaves you with a Strava style issue.

The only difference here is that logs will be returned for requests older than 5 minutes, and only one at a time . The need to write differnt queries to return differnt IDs, the fact that only one profile is returned at a time, and that the data is more or less avaliable elsewhere makes this a low priorty issue.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p> As it stands, the provided NotUber app is hugely vulnerable to security threats to the point of being non-functional. Some form of user validation would need to be implemented for this app to have any hope of continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further study could also investigate the potential to fill the database to the capacity allowed by the free tier.
