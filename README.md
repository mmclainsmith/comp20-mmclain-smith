#Conclusions

1. The purpose of this Git repository was to store our assignments for this course, make them accessible for grading, and help us learn to use Git.
2. I really enjoyed writing assignment 3 in python, because I think I'm getting sick of front ends and the way that JavaScript just fails silently.
3. I've realized that web development, at least the front end bit, probably really isn't for me.
4. A lot of the web is constructed shoddily. I knew SQL injections and the like existed, but I didn't realize how prevalent poor practices were. The metric ton of npm dependencies that seem to be involved in getting anything working is also concerning. 
5. I'd like to learn more about networks and concurrency.
